The Bibliographic Repository of the Systems Research and Architecture Group (SRA)
================================================================================

- `sra-own.bib`: All publications that were authored by
  members of the group. This file contains *no* @crossref entries. All
  @proceedings entries are actually workshops or conferenceses that
  were edited by an SRA member.

- `sra-ext.bib`: Shared bibliography file of all further refrences. 
  This file *makes use of  @crossref entries* (albeit not systematically). 

**Note** _The SRA bibliography itself is hosted at github at `https://github.com/luhsra/bib.git`. You may have found, however, this file somewhere on your local disc. If that is the case, it is very likely that you have found it in the local checkout/clone of some other svn/git repository, where it is embedded via git-submodule or svn:externals._
