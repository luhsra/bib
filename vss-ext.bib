  abstract = {Hardware disaggregation has emerged as one of the most fundamental shifts in how we build computer systems over the past decades. While disaggregation has been successful for several types of resources (storage, power, and others), memory disaggregation has yet to happen. We make the case that the time for memory disaggregation has arrived. We look at past successful disaggregation stories and learn that their success depended on two requirements: addressing a burning issue and being technically feasible. We examine memory disaggregation through this lens and find that both requirements are finally met. Once available, memory disaggregation will require software support to be used effectively. We discuss some of the challenges of designing an operating system that can utilize disaggregated memory for itself and its applications.},

To address this challenge, state-of-the-art runtimes employ theoretically optimal scheduling policies, namely a single request queue and strict preemption.We present Concord, a runtime that demonstrates how forgoing this design---while still closely approximating it---enables a significant improvement in application throughput while maintaining tight tail-latency SLOs. We evaluate Concord on microbenchmarks and Google's LevelDB key-value store; compared to the state of the art, Concord improves application throughput by up to 52\% on microbenchmarks and by up to 83\% on LevelDB, while meeting the same tail-latency SLOs. Unlike the state of the art, Concord is application agnostic and does not rely on the nonstandard use of hardware, which makes it immediately de-ployable in the public cloud. Concord is publicly available at https://dslab.epfl.ch/research/concord.},

The new, cache-coherent memory interconnect Compute Express Link (CXL) promises elastic memory capacity through memory pooling. In this work, we adapt the well-known IMDBMS, SAP HANA, for memory pools by features of table data placement and operational heap memory allocation on far memory, and study the impact of the limited bandwidth and higher latency of CXL. Our results show negligible performance degradation for TPC-C. For the analytical workloads of TPC-H, a notable impact on query processing is observed due to the limited bandwidth and long latency of our early CXL implementation. However, our emulation shows it would be acceptably smaller with the improved CXL memory devices.},

  abstract = {Public cloud providers seek to meet stringent performance requirements and low hardware cost. A key driver of performance and cost is main memory. Memory pooling promises to improve DRAM utilization and thereby reduce costs. However, pooling is challenging under cloud performance requirements. This paper proposes Pond, the first memory pooling system that both meets cloud performance goals and significantly reduces DRAM cost. Pond builds on the Compute Express Link (CXL) standard for load/store access to pool memory and two key insights. First, our analysis of cloud production traces shows that pooling across 8-16 sockets is enough to achieve most of the benefits. This enables a small-pool design with low access latency. Second, it is possible to create machine learning models that can accurately predict how much local and pool memory to allocate to a virtual machine (VM) to resemble same-NUMA-node memory performance. Our evaluation with 158 workloads shows that Pond reduces DRAM costs by 7\% with performance within 1-5\% of same-NUMA-node VM allocations.},

  abstract = {Modern cloud applications are prone to high tail latencies since their requests typically follow highly-dispersive distributions. Prior work has proposed both OS- and systemlevel solutions to reduce tail latencies for microsecond-scale workloads through better scheduling. Unfortunately, existing approaches like customized dataplane OSes, require significant OS changes, experience scalability limitations, or do not reach the full performance capabilities hardware offers. We propose LibPreemptible, a preemptive user-level threading library that is flexible, lightweight, and scalable. LibPreemptible is based on three key techniques: 1) a fast and lightweight hardware mechanism for delivery of timed interrupts, 2) a general-purpose user-level scheduling interface, and 3) an API for users to express adaptive scheduling policies tailored to the needs of their applications. Compared to the prior state-of-the-art scheduling system Shinjuku, our system achieves significant tail latency and throughput improvements for various workloads without the need to modify the kernel. We also demonstrate the flexibility of LibPreemptible across scheduling policies for real applications experiencing varying load levels and characteristics.},
