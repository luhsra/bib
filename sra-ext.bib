  ISBN={978-1-4503-3245-3},

  abstractNote={Control ﬂow defenses against ROP either use strict, expensive, but strong protection against redirected RET instructions with shadow stacks, or much faster but weaker protections without. In this work we study the inherent overheads of shadow stack schemes. We ﬁnd that the overhead is roughly 10% for a traditional shadow stack. We then design a new scheme, the parallel shadow stack, and show that its performance cost is signiﬁcantly less: 3.5%. Our measurements suggest it will not be easy to improve performance on current x86 processors further, due to inherent costs associated with RET and memory load/store instructions. We conclude with a discussion of the design decisions in our shadow stack instrumentation, and possible lighter-weight alternatives.},

A return-oriented program chains together short instruction sequences already present in a program’s address space, each of which ends in a “return” instruction.Return-oriented programming defeats the W⊕X protections recently deployed by Microsoft, Intel, and AMD; in this context, it can be seen as a generalization of traditional return-into-libc attacks. But the threat is more general. Return-oriented programming is readily exploitable on multiple architectures and systems. It also bypasses an entire category of security measures---those that seek to prevent malicious computation by preventing the execution of malicious code.To demonstrate the wide applicability of return-oriented programming, we construct a Turing-complete set of building blocks called gadgets using the standard C libraries of two very different architectures: Linux/x86 and Solaris/SPARC. To demonstrate the power of return-oriented programming, we present a high-level, general-purpose language for describing return-oriented exploits and a compiler that translates it to gadgets.},

	abstract  = {Return-oriented programming is an effective code-reuse attack in which short code sequences ending in a ret instruction are found within existing binaries and executed in arbitrary order by taking control of the stack. This allows for Turing-complete behavior in the target program without the need for injecting attack code, thus significantly negating current code injection defense efforts (e.g., W⊕X). On the other hand, its inherent characteristics, such as the reliance on the stack and the consecutive execution of return-oriented gadgets, have prompted a variety of defenses to detect or prevent it from happening.In this paper, we introduce a new class of code-reuse attack, called jump-oriented programming. This new attack eliminates the reliance on the stack and ret instructions (including ret-like instructions such as pop+jmp) seen in return-oriented programming without sacrificing expressive power. This attack still builds and chains functional gadgets, each performing certain primitive operations, except these gadgets end in an indirect branch rather than ret. Without the convenience of using ret to unify them, the attack relies on a dispatcher gadget to dispatch and execute the functional gadgets. We have successfully identified the availability of these jump-oriented gadgets in the GNU libc library. Our experience with an example shellcode attack demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of this technique.},

	address = {Berkeley, CA, USA},
	abstract = {Privilege separation partitions a single program into two parts: a privileged program called the monitor and an unprivileged program called the slave. All trust and privileges are relegated to the monitor, which results in a smaller and more easily secured trust base. Previously the privilege separation procedure, i.e., partitioning one program into the monitor and slave, was done by hand [18, 28]. We design techniques and develop a tool called Privtrans that allows us to automatically integrate privilege separation into source code, provided a few programmer annotations. For instance, our approach can automatically integrate the privilege separation previously done by hand in OpenSSH, while enjoying similar security benefits. Additionally, we propose optimization techniques that augment static analysis with dynamic information. Our optimization techniques reduce the number of expensive calls made by the slave to the monitor. We show Privtrans is effective by integrating privilege separation into several open-source applications.},

abstract = {Future microprocessors need low-cost solutions for reliable operation in the presence of failure-prone devices. A promising approach is to detect hardware faults by deploying low-cost monitors of software-level symptoms of such faults. Recently, researchers have shown these mechanisms work well, but there remains a non-negligible risk that several faults may escape the symptom detectors and result in silent data corruptions (SDCs). Most prior evaluations of symptom-based detectors perform fault injection campaigns on application benchmarks, where each run simulates the impact of a fault injected at a hardware site at a certain point in the application's execution (application fault site). Since the total number of application fault sites is very large (trillions for standard benchmark suites), it is not feasible to study all possible faults. Previous work therefore typically studies a randomly selected sample of faults. Such studies do not provide any feedback on the portions of the application where faults were not injected. Some of those instructions may be vulnerable to SDCs, and identifying them could allow protecting them through other means if needed.This paper presents Relyzer, an approach that systematically analyzes all application fault sites and carefully picks a small subset to perform selective fault injections for transient faults. Relyzer employs novel fault pruning techniques that prune faults that need detailed study by either predicting their outcomes or showing them equivalent to other faults. We find that Relyzer prunes about 99.78\% of the total faults across twelve applications studied here, reducing the faults that require detailed simulation by 3 to 5 orders of magnitude for most of the applications. Fault injection simulations on the remaining faults can identify SDC causing faults in the entire application. Some of Relyzer's techniques rely on heuristics to determine fault equivalence. Our validation efforts show that Relyzer determines fault outcomes with 96\% accuracy, averaged across all the applications studied here.},

  abstract = {Fork has long been the process creation system call for Unix. At its inception, fork was hailed as an efficient system call due to its use of copy-on-write on memory shared between parent and child processes. However, application memory demand has increased drastically since the early days and the cost incurred by fork to simply set up virtual memory (e.g., copy page tables) is now a concern, even for applications that only require hundreds of MBs of memory. In practice, fork performance already holds back system efficiency and latency across a range of uses cases that fork large processes, such as fault-tolerant systems, serverless frameworks, and testing frameworks.This paper proposes On-demand-fork, a fast implementation of the fork system call specifically designed for applications with large memory footprints. On-demand-fork relies on the observation that copy-on-write can be generalized to page tables, even on commodity hardware. On-demand-fork executes faster than the traditional fork implementation by additionally sharing page tables between parent and child at fork time and selectively copying page tables in small chunks, on-demand, when handling page faults. On-demand-fork is a drop-in replacement for fork that requires no changes to applications or hardware.We evaluated On-demand-fork on a range of micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads. On-demand-fork significantly reduces the fork invocation time and has improved scalability. For processes with 1 GB of allocated memory, On-demand-fork has a 65\texttimes{} performance advantage over Fork. We also evaluated On-demand-fork on testing, fuzzing, and snapshotting workloads of well-known applications, obtaining execution throughput improvements between 59\% and 226\% and up to 99\% invocation latency reduction.},

During on-line interaction, user-owned off-line detachable storage media such as cards and tape become highly undesirable. On the other hand, if all users are to be able to retain as much information as they wish in machine-accessible secondary storage, various needs become crucial: Little-used information must percolate to devices with longer access times, to allow ample space on faster devices for more frequently used files. Furthermore, information must be easy to access when required, it must be safe from accidents and maliciousness, and it should be accessible to other users on an easily controllable basis when desired. Finally, any consideration which is not basic to a user's ability to manipulate this information should be invisible to him unless he specifies otherwise.},

  abstract = {Hardware devices of recent technology nodes are intrinsically more susceptible to faults than previous devices. This demands further improvements of error detection methods. However, any attempt to cover all errors for all theoretically possible scenarios that a system might be used in can easily lead to excessive costs. Instead, an applicationdependent approach should be taken, i.e., strategies for test and error resilience must target only those errors that can actually have an effect in the situations in which the hardware is being used. In this paper, we propose a method to inject faults into hardware (HW) and to formally analyze their effects on the software (SW) behavior. We describe how this analysis can be implemented based on a recently proposed HW-dependent software model called program netlist (PN). We show how program netlists can be extended to formally model the behavior of a program in the event of one or more hardware faults. Then, it is demonstrated how the results of the PN-based analysis can be exploited by a standard ATPG tool to determine hardware faults at the gate level that are “application-redundant”. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

The computational model of the combined HW/SW system is a program netlist (PN) consisting of instruction cells connected in a directed acyclic graph that compactly represents all execution paths of the software. The model can be easily integrated into SAT-based verification environments such as those based on Bounded Model Checking (BMC). The proposed construction of the model allows for an efficient reasoning of the SAT solver over entire execution paths. Program netlists are compositional. The paper presents how they can be combined to model interrupt-driven systems. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by presenting experimental results from the formal verification of an industrial LIN (Local Interconnect Network) bus node, implemented as a software driver on a 32-bit RISC machine.},

Regression test selection techniques reuse tests from an existing test suite to test a modified program. Many regression test selection techniques have been proposed; however, it is difficult to compare and evaluate these techniques because they have different goals. This paper outlines the issues relevant to regression test selection techniques, and uses these issues as the basis for a framework within which to evaluate the techniques. We illustrate the application of our framework by using it to evaluate existing regression test selection techniques. The evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing techniques, and highlights some problems that future work in this area should address.},

	abstract = {Growth in Google's code size and feature churn rate has seen increased reliance on continuous integration (CI) and testing to maintain quality. Even with enormous resources dedicated to testing, we are unable to regression test each code change individually, resulting in increased lag time between code check-ins and test result feedback to developers. We report results of a project that aims to reduce this time by: (1) controlling test workload without compromising quality, and (2) distilling test results data to inform developers, while they write code, of the impact of their latest changes on quality. We model, empirically understand, and leverage the correlations that exist between our code, test cases, developers, programming languages, and code-change and test-execution frequencies, to improve our CI and development processes. Our findings show: very few of our tests ever fail, but those that do are generally "closer" to the code they test; certain frequently modified code and certain users/tools cause more breakages; and code recently modified by multiple developers (more than 3) breaks more often.},

	abstract = {Test case prioritization techniques schedule test cases for execution in an order that attempts to maximize some objective function. A variety of objective functions are applicable; one such function involves rate of fault detection --- a measure of how quickly faults are detected within the testing process. An improved rate of fault detection during regression testing can provide faster feedback on a system under regression test and let debuggers begin their work earlier than might otherwise be possible. In this paper, we describe several techniques for prioritizing test cases and report our empirical results measuring the effectiveness of these techniques for improving rate of fault detection. The results provide insights into the tradeoffs among various techniques for test case prioritization.},

  abstract =     "Technology scaling of integrated circuits is making transistors increasingly sensitive to process variations, wear-out effects and ionizing particles. This may lead to an increasing rate of transient and intermittent errors in future microprocessors. In order to assess the risk such errors pose to safety critical systems, it is essential to investigate how temporary errors in the instruction set architecture (ISA) registers and main memory locations influence the behaviour of executing programs. To this end, we investigate -- by means of extensive fault injection experiments -- how such errors affect the execution of four target programs. The paper makes three contributions. First, we investigate how the failure modes of the target programs vary for different input sets. Second, we evaluate the error coverage of a software-implemented hardware fault tolerant technique that relies on triple-time redundant execution, majority voting and forward recovery. Third, we propose an approach based on assembly language metrics which can be used to correlate the dynamic fault-free behaviour of a program with its failure mode distribution obtained by fault injection.",

  abstract =     {Energy efficiency has become an increasingly important concern in computer architecture due to the end of Dennard scaling. Heterogeneity has been explored as a way to achieve better energy efficiency and heterogeneous microarchitecture chips have become common in the mobile setting. Recent research has explored using heterogeneous-ISA, heterogeneous microarchitecture, general-purpose cores to achieve further energy efficiency gains. However, there is no open-source hardware implementation of a heterogeneous-ISA processor available for research, and effective research on heterogeneous-ISA processors necessitates the emulation speed provided by FPGA prototyping. This work describes our experiences creating JuxtaPiton by integrating a small RISC-V core into the OpenPiton framework, which uses a modified OpenSPARC T1 core. This is the first time a new core has been integrated with the OpenPiton framework, and JuxtaPiton is the first open-source, general-purpose, heterogeneous-ISA processor. JuxtaPiton inherits all the capabilities of OpenPiton, including vital FPGA emulation infrastructure which can boot full-stack Debian Linux. Using this infrastructure, we investigate area and timing effects of using the new RISC-V core on FPGA and the performance of the new core running microbenchmarks.},

  DOI={10.1145/1375634.1375641},
  abstractNote={Today, many modern processors support more than one page size. The larger pages, called superpages, have been identiﬁed as one means of reducing the time spent servicing translation lookaside buffer (TLB) misses in the early 1990s by increasing TLB reach. Widespread usage of superpages has been limited by the requirement that superpages consist of physically contiguous and naturally-aligned small pages. This makes external fragmentation a serious problem for an operating system, one that is almost nonexistent when processes use only one page size. Hardware solutions to mitigate this limitation such as sub-blocking, shadow page-tables and a variety of hybrid solutions have not seen wide-spread adoption. This has curtailed automatic superpage support as it is known that superpage availability will decrease during the system’s lifetime as external fragmentation grows.},

We rely on this basic idea, which increases flexibility to increase error protection capabilities, improve power efficiency, and reduce system cost; with only small performance overheads. We augment the virtual memory system architecture to detach the physical mapping of data from the physical mapping of its associated ECC information. We then use this mechanism to develop two-tiered error protection techniques that separate the process of detecting errors from the rare need to also correct errors, and thus save energy. We describe how to provide strong chipkill and double-chip kill protection using existing DRAM and packaging technology. We show how to maintain access granularity and redundancy overheads, even when using \texttimes{}8 DRAM chips. We also evaluate error correction for systems that do not use ECC DIMMs. Overall, analysis of demanding SPEC CPU 2006 and PARSEC benchmarks indicates that performance overhead is only 1\% with ECC DIMMs and less than 10\% using standard Non-ECC DIMM configurations, that DRAM power savings can be as high as 27\%, and that the system energy-delay product is improved by 12\% on average.},
